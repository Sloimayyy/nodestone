Identity nodes in chunks, so that nodes close together are more likely to be close together in mem too. 
^ To try very quickly, this sounds like a super easy great improvement

Comparator -> torch
Remove 0 constants
Remove inputs that are too far away (mostly already done)
Comparator max SS they can output optimisations
