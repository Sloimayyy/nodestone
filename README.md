Standalone redstone simulator with multiple backends.

Currently 4 exists: `gpubackend`, `mamba`, `ripper` and `shrimple`\
The first 3 don't compile anymore and were left in various unfinished states. But I keep them there as archives.
Just a thing I do a lot lol.

Depends on: mcvolume, smath and gson
Could look into shadowing further
